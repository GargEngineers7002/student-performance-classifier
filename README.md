# Student Performance Classifier Project 🎓

## Overview
This is a Machine Learning **Classification** project that predicts whether a student will **Pass or Fail** based on their academic and lifestyle data.

## Goal
To build a machine learning model that learns the relationship between student performance factors (study hours, attendance, sleep, past grades, practice tests) and their final outcome (Pass/Fail).
