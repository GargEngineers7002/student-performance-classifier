Project Goal: Build a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a student will Pass or Fail based on academic and lifestyle features.
⚠️ Judging Criteria (Pass Requirements)
Your model must pass the following 3 tests to be accepted:

Test 1: The Accuracy Score
Since this is a classification task, we evaluate performance using Accuracy.
Requirement: Your model must achieve an Accuracy of 0.85 or higher on the Test Set.
Why? This proves your model correctly classifies most students.

Test 2: The Confusion Matrix (Visual Proof)
Since we predict categories (Pass/Fail) instead of exact numbers, we use a Confusion Matrix.
Requirement: Save a confusion matrix plot where:
X-Axis: Predicted Labels
Y-Axis: Actual Labels
Labels: Pass (1), Fail (0)
Visual Check: Most values should be on the diagonal (correct predictions)
Why? This visually proves your classifier isn’t mislabeling students randomly.

Test 3: The F1 Score (Error Balance Check)
Requirement: Your model must achieve an F1 Score of 0.80 or higher.
Why? This ensures your model balances Precision and Recall properly and doesn’t favor only one class (e.g., predicting everyone as “Pass”).
