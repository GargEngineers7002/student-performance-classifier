Execution Plan (Step-by-Step)
This roadmap guides students from setup all the way to passing the automated judging tests.

hase 1: Setup & Data Preparation
Repository: Create a new GitHub repository named student-performance-classifier.
Environment: Set up a local Python environment (using virtualenv or Conda).
Data: Create a file named student_data.csv inside a dataset/ folder and paste the provided dataset into it.

Phase 2: Exploration & Analysis
Load: Import pandas and read the CSV file.
Visualize: Create histograms or box plots for each feature.
Create a correlation heatmap to understand which features influence Pass/Fail the most.
Plot study hours vs. pass/fail to visually inspect class separation.

Phase 3: Building the Model
Split: Divide the data into a Training Set (80%) and a Test Set (20%) using train_test_split.
Scale: Use StandardScaler to normalize the feature values.
Train: Import LogisticRegression from Scikit-Learn and fit the model on the Training Set only.

Phase 4: Internal Evaluation (The "Self-Check")
Predict: Use the model to predict Pass/Fail labels for the Test Set.
Calculate Metrics: Instead of RMSE and R², calculate:
Accuracy: Must be 0.85 or higher
Precision
Recall
F1 Score: Must be 0.80 or higher
Visualize Results: Plot a Confusion Matrix heatmap.
Plot the ROC Curve to inspect classification performance.

Phase 5: Validation & Submission (Crucial Step)
Run the Judging Block: Add the specific "Validation Code" provided at the end of the notebook.
Generate Proof: Ensure the code successfully passes the thresholds and generates the submission/ folder containing:
model_performance.txt (The classification report)
confusion_matrix.png (The visual proof plot)
roc_curve.png (The ROC performance plot)
Push to GitHub: Commit all files (including the submission/ folder) and push them to the repository for review.
